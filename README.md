# 💵 DT Money

An application to help you keep track of your money.

This is version 3.0

## 🏃‍♂️ My journey

<p align="center">
    <strong>This project was built around August 2022, despite the commits saying otherwise... </strong>
</p>

At this point, my react skills were consolidated. This project was mostly about learning and testing out new, amazing libraries while remaking DT Money, one of the first projects I built.   

This still has what I consider today to be a bit of messy code, but nothing that can't be fixed by creating a few more files to make it cleaner.
